"""Shared IATI terminology used in tool descriptions and plugin instructions.

Covers the IATI 2.03 activity standard as modelled by the okfn_iati library:
its enums mirror the IATI codelists and its CSV converter flattens activities,
dates, descriptions, participating organisations, sectors, transactions,
budgets, locations, documents, results, indicators, indicator periods,
conditions, contact info and country budget items. Every entry below maps to
one of those elements or codelists.
